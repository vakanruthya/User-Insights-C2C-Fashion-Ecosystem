Motivation: The motivation behind this project stems from the companyâ€™s vision to lead the transformation of the C2C fashion market by empowering users and driving sustainable commerce. As a competitive platform, understanding user behavior is essential to foster meaningful engagement, improving user retention, and maximizing sales opportunities. With the increasing consumer demand for personalized experiences and eco-conscious choices, this project aims to position the platform as a trusted, innovative leader in the second-hand fashion space. By leveraging deeper data insights, the company can enhance customer satisfaction, refine its offerings, and expand its market reach, all while contributing to a more sustainable and connected fashion ecosystem.

Objectives: The objective of this analysis is to optimize the French C2C fashion platform by understanding user behavior, geographic trends, and platform usage to improve engagement and retention. The study aims to identify untapped demographics (e.g., younger women, male users), enhance website and app experiences, and drive wishlist-to-purchase conversions. It focuses on leveraging high-retention markets like Denmark and Sweden as models for growth, while addressing churn in key markets like France and the US. Strategic recommendations include localized campaigns, incentivized app usage, and targeted re-engagement in underperforming regions, with an emphasis on diversifying the user base and expanding into untapped markets for sustained growth.
